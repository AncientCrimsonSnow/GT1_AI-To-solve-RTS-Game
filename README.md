# GT1_AI-to-solve-RTS-Game
This repository contains the practical part of the Game Technologies 1 (GT1) course M.Sc..

## Project Overview
This repository implements an AI for a real-time strategy game developed in Java. The AI applies data-oriented design principles for efficient gameplay management.

## Features
- **Data-Oriented Design:** Clear separation between data, system, and test classes for better maintainability.
- **Board Management:** Efficient handling of a 256x256 game board using area-based management.
- **Client Management:** A multi-threaded client system for interaction with the server.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive tests for all components using a test grid and various states.
